    title: “After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
      and dig, dig— now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
      hands—to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
      hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
      passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
      reality of mist and rain on his cheek.” (A Tale of Two Cities)
