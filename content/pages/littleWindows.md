      '“After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig—
      now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands—to dig this wretched
      creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would
      suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the
      window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.” (A Tale of Two Cities)'
